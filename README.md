Description:
Suppose you are developing a solution for an online newspaper. They have very simple requirements. They publish
about 10-15 articles on a daily basis. They recruit a new Editor every single month. The job of the editor is to publish
the articles. There is an Administrator who manages all these editors. The Administrator can add or remove new
Editors into and from the system. Please note that whenever they recruit a new Editor, they let go of the previous
Editor. It means, there can only be ONE editor active in the system to post any new articles
